RoboPhery: Robotic Peripherals Project
======================================


Design and implementation of Python library for interfacing low level hardware
sensors and actuators with MQTT and TSDB bindings. The system architecture is
designed to be so simple at hardware level to support sigle-board
microcontrollers like ESP2866, ESP32 modules as well as sigle-board computers
based on ARM or x86 architectures. The communication among devices is handled
by the standard MQTT message bus.
