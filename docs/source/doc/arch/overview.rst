Project Introduction
====================

This paper explains how to utilise inexpensive Linux or MicroPython compatible
devices, actuators and sensors to serve as fully autonomous and isolated agent
systems that can perform continuous automation for various applications. These
scenarios range from smart home or environmental automation, surveillance, to
full ambient intelligence  automation.

The architecture of autonomous agents with connections to the overlay message
bus for monitoring and controlling these systems is introduced in the first
chapter. These systems use scalable and modular architecture to minimise the
computational overhead which allows efficient use of available hardware
resources.

The next part covers the autononocity of agents in more details. Logical and
physical models of the system with description of the virtual functions that
provide the simple thresholds or fuzzy logic reasoning.

The final chapter covers the overlay controlling and monitoring system that
can communicate with multiple autonomous systems, gather vital information and
even start arbitrary actions on demand. The control system contains time-
series database and second level of reasoning which can detect hardware
malfunctions within the autonomous agent systems and perform necessary steps
to. The usage of these proposed and implemented systems may go far beyond the
original scope to monitor and control virtually any software or physical
system.
