BlueTooth Devices
=================

Bluetooth uses the same 2.4Ghz unlicensed band as most Wi-Fi routers.
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is also known as Bluetooth 4.0 and Bluetooth Smart.
It's called low-energy because it basically is. BLE devices can run for more
than 2 years with a single coin battery depending on the signal strenth and
how frequently they broadcast information.

Apple iBeacon uses Bluetooth Low Energy to create 'beacon' around regions so
apps can be alerted when users enter them. The hardware beacons are a small
wireless sensors placed inside any physical space that transmit data to your
iPhone using Bluetooth Low Energy. iOS devices can also be iBeacons. Whilst
Google have focussed on Near Field Communication (NFC), Android V4.3 has
native support for Bluetooth Low Energy.
