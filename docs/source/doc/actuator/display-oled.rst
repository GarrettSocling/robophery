OLED Display
============

An organic light-emitting diode (OLED) is a light-emitting diode (LED) in
which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound that
emits light in response to an electric current. This layer of organic
semiconductor is situated between two electrodes; typically, at least one of
these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create digital displays in
devices such as television screens, computer monitors, portable systems such
as mobile phones, handheld game consoles and PDAs. A major area of research is
the development of white OLED devices for use in solid-state lighting
applications.


0,96" 128x64 - IÂ²C OLED Display
===============================

These displays are small, only about 1" diagonal, but very readable due to the
high contrast of an OLED display. This display is made of 128x32 individual
white OLED pixels, each one is turned on or off by the controller chip.
Because the display makes its own light, no backlight is required. This
reduces the power required to run the OLED and is why the display has such
high contrast. The driver chip SSD1306, communicates via I2C only.
