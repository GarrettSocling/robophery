HD44780 controller - GPIO LCD display
=====================================

Standard HD44780 LCDs are useful for creating standalone projects. Comes in
16x2 or 20x4 sizes. Connection port is 0.1" pitch, single row for easy
breadboarding and wiring. Pins are documented on the back of the LCD to assist
in wiring it up. Single LED backlight included can be dimmed easily with a
resistor or PWM and uses much less power than LCD with EL (electroluminescent)
backlights.
