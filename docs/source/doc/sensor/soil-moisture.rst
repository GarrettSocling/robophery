Measuring Soil Moisture
=======================


Hygrometer - GPIO/AIN Soil Moisture Sensor
==========================================

Soil moisture sensors measure the water content in soil. A soil moisture probe
is made up of multiple soil moisture sensors. One common type of soil moisture
sensors in commercial use is a frequency domain sensor such as a capacitance
sensor. Another sensor, the neutron moisture gauge, utilize the moderator
properties of water for neutrons. Cheaper sensors - often for home use - are
based on two electrodes measuring the resistance of the soil. Sometimes this
simply consists of two bare (galvanized) wires, but there are also probes with
wires embedded in gypsum.

Time domain transmission (TDT) and time domain reflectometry (TDR) is also
used to measure moisture content; water has a high dielectric constant; a
higher water concentration causes a higher average dielectric constant for the
soil. The average dielectric constant can be sensed by measuring the speed of
propagation along a buried transmission line.
