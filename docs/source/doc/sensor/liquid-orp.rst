Measuring Reduction Potencial (ORP) of Liquid
=============================================

Reduction potential (also known as redox potential, oxidation / reduction
potential, ORP, pE)  is a measure of the tendency of a chemical species to
acquire electrons and thereby be reduced. Reduction potential is measured in
volts (V), or millivolts (mV). Each species has its own intrinsic reduction
potential; the more positive the potential, the greater the species' affinity
for electrons and tendency to be reduced. ORP is a common measurement for
water quality.

Atlas Scientific ORP Kit - I²C Liquid ORP Sensor
================================================

The Atlas Scientific ORP Kit comes with everything you need to get your
laboratory grade embedded ORP system up and running.

Remember, a ORP Probe cannot be allowed to dry out or freeze. When it’s not in
use keep it in the supplied soaker bottle. Periodically change out the storage
solution in the soaker bottle with new storage solution.
