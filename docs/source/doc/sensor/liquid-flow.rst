Measuring Flow of Liquid
========================

Flow measurement is the quantification of bulk fluid movement. Flow can be
measured in a variety of ways. Positive-displacement flow meters accumulate a
fixed volume of fluid and then count the number of times the volume is filled
to measure flow. Other flow measurement methods rely on forces produced by the
flowing stream as it overcomes a known constriction, to indirectly calculate
flow. Flow may be measured by measuring the velocity of fluid over a known
area.

Plastic 1/2" - GPIO Liquid Flow Meter
=====================================

Measure liquid/water flow for your solar, computer cooling, or gardening
project using this handy basic flow meter. This sensor sit in line with your
water line, and uses a pinwheel sensor to measure how much liquid has moved
through it. The pinwheel has a little magnet attached, and there's a hall
effect magnetic sensor on the other side of the plastic tube that can measure
how many spins the pinwheel has made through the plastic wall. This method
allows the sensor to stay safe and dry.

The sensor comes with three wires: red (5-24VDC power), black (ground) and
yellow (Hall effect pulse output). By counting the pulses from the output of
the sensor, you can easily track fluid movement: each pulse is approximately
2.25 milliliters. Note this isn't a precision sensor, and the pulse rate does
vary a bit depending on the flow rate, fluid pressure and sensor orientation.
It will need careful calibration if better than 10% precision is required.
However, its great for basic measurement tasks!
