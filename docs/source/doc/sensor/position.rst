MPU6050 - I²C 3 Axis Accelerometer and Gyroscope
================================================

By combining a MEMS 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer on the same
silicon die together with an onboard Digital Motion Processor™ (DMP™) capable
of processing complex 9-axis MotionFusion algorithms, the MPU-6050 does away
with the cross-axis alignment problems that can creep up on discrete parts.

LSM9DS0 - I²C 3 Axis Accelerometer, Magnetometer and Gyroscope
==============================================================

Inside the chip are three sensors, one is a classic 3-axis accelerometer,
which can tell you which direction is down towards the Earth (by measuring
gravity) or how fast the board is accelerating in 3D space. The other is a
3-axis magnetometer that can sense where the strongest magnetic force is
coming from, generally used to detect magnetic north.  The third is a 3-axis
gyroscope that can measure spin and twist.

FXAS21002C - I²C 3 Axis Gyroscope
=================================

FXAS21002C is a small, low-power, yaw, pitch, and roll angular rate gyroscope
with 16 bit ADC resolution. The full-scale range is adjustable from ±250°/s to
±2000°/s. It features both I2C and SPI interfaces.

FXAS21002C is capable of measuring angular rates up to ±2000°/s, with output
data rates (ODR) from 12.5 to 800 Hz. An integrated Low-Pass Filter (LPF)
allows the host application to limit the digital signal bandwidth. The device
may be configured to generate an interrupt when a user-programmable angular
rate threshold is crossed on any one of the enabled axes.
