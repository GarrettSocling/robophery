Measuring Air Pressure
======================

Atmospheric pressure, sometimes also called barometric pressure, is the
pressure within the atmosphere of Earth (or that of another planet). In most
circumstances atmospheric pressure is closely approximated by the hydrostatic
pressure caused by the weight of air above the measurement point. As elevation
increases, there is less overlying atmospheric mass, so that atmospheric
pressure decreases with increasing elevation. Pressure measures force per unit
area, with SI units of pascals (1 Pa = 1 N/m2).
