T6713 - I²C CO2 Concentration Sensor
====================================

The new T6700 series is a miniature NDIR CO2 sensor that has accuracy and
reliability of many larger sensors. The new small size allows OEM’s to
integrate in to smaller enclosures and equipment and uses significantly less
power than many other devices on the market.

The Telaire T6713 CO2 Module is ideal for applications where accurate CO2
levels need to be measured and controlled for indoor air quality and energy
saving applications such as demand control ventilation.

All units are factory calibrated to measure CO2 concentration levels up to
5000ppm, while maintaining accuracy across the range.
