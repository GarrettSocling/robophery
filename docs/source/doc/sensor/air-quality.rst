T6713 - I²C CO2 Concentration Sensor
====================================

The new T6700 series is a miniature NDIR CO2 sensor that has accuracy and
reliability of many larger sensors. The new small size allows OEM’s to
integrate in to smaller enclosures and equipment and uses significantly less
power than many other devices on the market.

The Telaire T6713 CO2 Module is ideal for applications where accurate CO2
levels need to be measured and controlled for indoor air quality and energy
saving applications such as demand control ventilation.

All units are factory calibrated to measure CO2 concentration levels up to
5000ppm, while maintaining accuracy across the range.

SGP30 - I²C CO2 Concentration and Volatile Organic Compound Sensor
==================================================================

This is a gas sensor that can detect a wide range of Volatile Organic Compounds
(VOCs) and H2 and is intended for indoor air quality monitoring. When connected
to your microcontroller (running our library code) it will return a Total
Volatile Organic Compound (TVOC) reading and an equivalent carbon dioxide
reading (eCO2) over I2C.

The SGP30 has a 'standard' hot-plate MOX sensor, as well as a small
microcontroller that controls power to the plate, reads the analog voltage,
tracks the baseline calibration, calculates TVOC and eCO2 values, and provides
an I2C interface to read from. Unlike the CCS811, this sensor does not require
I2C clock stretching.
