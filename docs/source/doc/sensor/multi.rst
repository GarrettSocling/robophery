CC2541 SensorTag Kit
====================

The SensorTag is fitted with six sensors and all sensors are chosen to be
small, energy efficient and low cost surface mount devices. The sensors use
I2C interface and are connected to the same interface bus with separate enable
signals. To minimize current consumption all sensors are by default disabled
and they are in sleep mode between measurements. Each sensor can be enabled
and read individually. The SensorTag includes the following sensors:

* IR Temperature Sensor (TMP006) from Texas Instruments, http://www.ti.com/product/tmp006
* Humidity Sensor (SHT21) from Sensirion, http://www.sensirion.com/en/products/humidity-temperature/humidity-sensor-sht21/
* Pressure Sensor (T5400) from Epcos, http://www.epcos.com/inf/57/ds/T5400.pdf
* Accelerometer (KXTJ9) from Kionix, http://www.kionix.com/accelerometers/kxtj9
* Gyroscope (IMU-3000) from InvenSense, http://www.invensense.com/mems/gyro/imu3000.html
* Magnetometer (MAG3110) from Freescale, http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=MAG3110

CC2650 SensorTag Kit
====================

The new TI SensorTag is based on the CC2650 ultra-low power wireless MCU,
offering a high-performance ARM® Cortex®-M3 and a fraction of the power
consumption compared to previous Bluetooth® Smart products. It also includes
cloud support, letting you move your sensor data from the smartphone app to
the cloud with a simple touch on the screen.
