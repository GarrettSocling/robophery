Measuring Electric Conductivity of Liquid
=========================================

In electrolytes, electrical conduction happens not by band electrons or holes,
but by full atomic species (ions) traveling, each carrying an electrical
charge. The resistivity of ionic solutions (electrolytes) varies tremendously
with concentration – while distilled water is almost an insulator, salt water
is a reasonable electrical conductor. Conduction in ionic liquids is also
controlled by the movement of ions, but here we are talking about molten salts
rather than solvated ions. In biological membranes, currents are carried by
ionic salts. Small holes in cell membranes, called ion channels, are selective
to specific ions and determine the membrane resistance.

Atlas Scientific EC Kit - I²C Liquid Electric Conductivity Sensor
=================================================================

A conductivity probe is a very simple device. It is just two conductors with a
fixed surface area at a fixed distance from each other. This distance and
surface area is known as the conductivity cell. The cells distance and surface
area is quantified as the conductivity cells K constant.

This Atlas Scientific conductivity probe, has a cell constant of K 1.0 When
this conductivity probe is connected to an Atlas Scientific EZOTM conductivity
circuit, it has a range of 5 µS/cm to 200,000 µS/cm.
