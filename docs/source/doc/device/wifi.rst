ESP32
=====

ESP32 is highly-integrated with in-built antenna switches, RF balun, power
amplifier, low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and power management modules.
ESP32 adds priceless functionality and versatility to your applications with
minimal Printed Circuit Board (PCB) area requirements.

SP32 can perform as a complete standalone system or as a slave device to a
host MCU, reducing communication stack overhead on the main application
processor. ESP32 can interface with other systems to provide Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth functionality through the SPI / SDIO or I2C / UART interfaces.

Onion Omega2
============

Omega2 is a personal single-board computer created by a startup company called
Onion, released on Kickstarter. It is advertised as "the world's smallest
Linux Server" The system combines the tiny form factor and power- efficiency
of the Arduino, with the power and flexibilities of the Raspberry Pi and is
identified with FCC Identifier 2AJVP-OMEGA2. It runs Linux kernel based
lightweight operating system for embedded system called OpenWRT.
