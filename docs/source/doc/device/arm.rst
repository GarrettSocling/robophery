Single-board Computers
======================

A single-board computer (SBC) is a complete computer built on a single circuit
board, with microprocessor(s), memory, input/output (I/O) and other features
required of a functional computer. Single-board computers were made as
demonstration or development systems, for educational systems, or for use as
embedded computer controllers. Many types of home computers or portable
computers integrate all their functions onto a single printed circuit board.
